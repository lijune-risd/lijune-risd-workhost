            Gimbap or "김밥" is similar to the Japanese mari.
            Like sushi, Gimbap has sorts of variations that you can customize
            to your own good. From cooked sauted meat to
            Carrots, Korean root vegetables, and Cucumber --
            Gimbap essentially holds together a customizable experience for your
            to curate. Every Korean has their own personal Gimbap experience tailored
            based on their surroundings. The website aims to make you create your
            own "Gimbap" as well.

          When you prepare for the food for Gimbap, you have to prep many Ingredients
          depending on what you choose. For example, when you prepare the vegetables

          Same goes for the rest of the other ingredients.

          Due to the vast ingredients that can be placed inside a Gimbap,
          one is allowed to customize their own set of Gimbap.
          Due to this customization, Gimbap has led me to the idea of emoticons.
          In today's digital customization era, I wanted to create an icon Generator
          that allows one to customize their own gimbap as well.
